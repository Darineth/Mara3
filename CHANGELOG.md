# Changelog

All notable changes to Mara 3 are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

<!-- On release, rename [Unreleased] to the new version + date and start a fresh
     [Unreleased] section above it. -->

## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.4] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Scroll-back history** — the server retains more messages per channel (default 1000)
  and sends only a recent chunk on join; scrolling to the top of a channel pages in
  older messages on demand, keeping your place. Tunable via `MARA_HISTORY_LIMIT`
  (retention) and `MARA_HISTORY_CHUNK` (page size). Messages now carry a stable
  server-assigned id used to order and de-duplicate history.

### Changed

- The message composer now shows what you type in your own display colour, matching
  how your messages appear in the log.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- Clicking a link in chat now opens it in the system browser on the desktop clients.
  The modern (Tauri 2) client blocked the `target="_blank"` new window, so links did
  nothing there; the app now routes a link click through the native opener instead.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- Dark theme: the primary background is now solid black, with `#111` for secondary
  surfaces (panels, sidebar, dialogs, the message input, code blocks, and revealed
  spoilers).
- Monospace text (code) now uses the platform default (`ui-monospace, monospace`)
  instead of bundling Cascadia Code / Consolas.

### Fixed

- A soft-wrapped list item no longer splits its list: an indented continuation line
  now folds into its bullet/numbered item instead of ending the list and starting a
  new one at the next marker.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **`/roll` dice** — roll D&D-style dice with `/roll [p][-]NdM[±K]`: `p` keeps the
  result private, `-` shows each die, and an optional `±K` modifier adjusts the total.
  Public rolls emote the result to the channel.

### Changed

- Darkened the dark theme's background to a deeper near-black.

### Fixed

- Pasting an image and pressing Enter no longer discards it: a bare upload path
  (`/uploads/…`) is now sent as a message instead of being mistaken for an unknown
  slash command and swallowed.
- Your own outgoing private messages are now written to the desktop client's local
  chat log — previously only the other participant's lines were logged, because the
  server never echoes a sent PM back to its sender.
- The message-of-the-day no longer appears at the top of private-message threads; it
  stays a channel greeting.
- Clicking an inline image no longer also opens it in the system browser on the Win7
  desktop client — a plain click just opens the in-app lightbox. (The image link
  dropped `target="_blank"`, which that client's older WebView2 opened externally even
  though the click was handled in-app.)

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-30

First release of Mara 3 — a self-hosted, account-less chat app. A single Node server
hosts the web UI and the WebSocket on one port; a portable desktop client and a
separate Windows 7 client load the same server-hosted UI. The wire protocol is clean
JSON-over-WebSocket and is deliberately not compatible with the old Qt-era Mara 2.

### Added

- **Channels** — auto-joined "Main", join more with `+`, collapsible sidebar, unread
  highlighting (private messages stronger), and join/leave/disconnect system lines.
- **Private messages** — a closable tab per peer; a thread migrates to the peer's new
  token by name so the conversation survives a reconnect.
- **Rich text** — Discord-style markdown (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough,
  spoiler), code blocks, and optional emoticons. Inline images from URLs render as a
  tile below the message (click to lightbox, hide/restore), detected by file
  extension, a query-declared format (`?format=jpg`, `&fm=png`), or a `!<url>` sender
  marker. Legacy Mara 2 BBCode tags (`[img]`, `[spoiler]`, `[b]`, `[i]`, `[u]`, `[s]`)
  are also recognized for backwards compatibility.
- **Image uploads** — server temp-stores images with per-file and rolling-cache size
  caps; `/upload` requires a WebSocket session token; SVG is rejected; files are
  served with `nosniff` and a sandbox CSP.
- **Persistent identity and history** — a client-chosen identity key maps to a stable
  server token, so identity survives reconnects and restarts; message history is
  persisted and replayed on join; the same user is multiplexed across windows.
- **Reconnect UX** — auto-connect on load, drops and recoveries noted in chat,
  always-on timestamps, component version display, and stale-client detection.
- **Theme** — System / Dark / Light toggle.
- **Desktop client** (Tauri 2) — a single portable `.exe` with an in-app server
  picker, settings stored next to the executable (portable), and opt-in auto-connect.
- **Windows 7 client** (Tauri 1) — a separate legacy target built with a static CRT
  and a bundled WebView2 fixed runtime.
- **Server configuration** — every setting (port, host, server name, MOTD, WebSocket
  path, upload caps, history limit, ...) is read from `MARA_*` environment variables,
  and the portable bundle also reads an optional `mara.config` file next to the
  launcher. Precedence is defaults < `mara.config` < environment; only `MARA_*` keys
  are honored. The bundle ships a commented `mara.config.example`.
- **Distribution** — `pnpm package`, `package:legacy`, `package:zip`, and
  `package:all` build self-contained server, web, and desktop artifacts into `dist/`,
  and zip each into version-stamped archives carrying a BUILD-INFO manifest, plus a
  top-level manifest and `SHA256SUMS.txt`. The packaged server uses a flat (hoisted)
  `node_modules` so the bundle is portable once extracted.

### Security

- Zod validation of every protocol frame in both directions; malformed frames are
  rejected without dropping the socket.
- The HTML render pipeline escapes all user-controlled fields; URLs are limited to
  `http(s)` and relative `/uploads/` paths, with a documented single-pass restore.
- Upload hardening: SVG rejected, strict filename handling, `nosniff` + sandbox CSP,
  and size caps; `/upload` requires a WS session token; WebSocket payloads are capped.
